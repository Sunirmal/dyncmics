you are a crm developer. Plese suggest a design approach and create a project with the below condition
1. Opportunity entity has M:1 relationship with contract
2. Opportunity entity has M:1 relationsip with Account

when user add/update addres contract from opportunity, it will call address review service store data to a related entity , please suggest that the service info can be stored within the same contract entity and store in another entity and map it to contract.

when user add/update Acccount entity, it will call address review service ,it will call address review service store data to a related entity , please suggest that the service info can be stored within the same contract entity and store in another entity and map it to Account. this service is a kafka based , once it receives the response it inserts data in the events entity . and a plugin will read the record and update account entity.

please suggest a design and changes in entities and plugin and other java script code

Thought for 6s

Nice — let’s design this as a maintainable, resilient Dataverse / Dynamics 365 solution with a Kafka-based address review pipeline. I’ll present two storage options (keep review data on the same entity vs. separate entity), recommend one, show entity changes, integration architecture, plugin & client (JS) responsibilities, and give ready-to-use code skeletons for the key pieces (C# plugin + Dynamics Web API JS + Node Azure Function Kafka producer + Node consumer that writes responses back). I’ll also call out operational concerns (auth, retries, idempotency, security).

Summary recommendation (short)

Preferred design: Create a separate AddressReviewRequest entity and an AddressReviewEvent (response) entity. Link AddressReviewRequest N:1 to Contract and N:1 to Account (nullable) so one request can be associated with either a Contract or an Account. This keeps service metadata normalized, avoids schema bloat, and is easier to audit & reprocess.

Workflow: user edits address → front-end or server plugin creates an AddressReviewRequest (status = Pending) → an external worker (Azure Function / Node service) polls or listens for new Pending requests and produces a Kafka message → external address-review service responds to Kafka topic → a Kafka consumer writes an AddressReviewEvent record into Dataverse → a Dataverse plugin (sync or async) on AddressReviewEvent.Create will read response and update the related Account/Contract fields.

Alternate (simpler) pattern: store review fields directly on Contract/Account (AddressReview_* fields). Use when volume is tiny and you want zero joins. I’ll give pros/cons below.

High-level architecture (textual diagram)

Dynamics UI (Opportunity form) — user edits address on Contract or Account related to Opportunity.

Client JS (form script) or server C# Plugin creates AddressReviewRequest record in Dataverse (status = Pending).

External Worker (Azure Function / Node service) polls Dataverse for Pending requests (or subscribes through Dataverse change feed / webhook) → builds and produces Kafka message to AddressReviewRequest topic.

Address Review Service (external system) processes and pushes response to Kafka reply topic.

Kafka Consumer (Node / Java microservice) receives response, creates AddressReviewEvent record in Dataverse with correlationId, payload, score, status.

Dataverse Plugin registered on AddressReviewEvent Create -> reads event and updates Account/Contract (fields or related AddressReview link), sets audit/log, flags request processed.

(I strongly prefer the external worker + Kafka consumer approach over having plug-ins call Kafka directly — plugins should not block on external services.)

Entities / Schema
New custom entities

addressreview_request (AddressReviewRequest)

addressreviewrequestid (GUID)

name (string) — e.g., "ARR-<correlationId>"

correlationid (string) — unique id used in Kafka message

contractid (lookup to contract) — optional

accountid (lookup to account) — optional

originentity (string) — "Contract" | "Account"

requestpayload (multiline text / JSON)

requestdate (datetime)

statuscode (optionset) — Pending / Sent / Failed / Processed

sent_on (datetime)

retrycount (int)

last_error (multiline text)

addressreview_event (AddressReviewEvent) — responses from Kafka

addressrevieweventid (GUID)

correlationid (string)

contractid (lookup to contract) — optional (duplicate to persist mapping)

accountid (lookup to account) — optional

eventpayload (multiline text / JSON) — raw response

score (decimal) / verdict (optionset)

eventdate (datetime)

processed (two-state) or optionset — Created / Applied / Error

appliedon (datetime)

appliedby (lookup to system user)

(Optional) addressreview_log or audit table for successes/errors — or rely on Dataverse auditing.

Alternative (less preferred) add fields on existing entities

Add fields to contract & account:

addressreview_status, addressreview_score, addressreview_lastpayload (json), addressreview_lastdate, addressreview_correlationid

Pros: Simple, fewer lookups.

Cons: Harder to keep history, reprocessing, volume bloat, harder to trace multiple requests.

Data relationships & mapping

addressreview_request N:1 -> Contract

addressreview_request N:1 -> Account

addressreview_event N:1 -> Contract

addressreview_event N:1 -> Account
(Only one of the two lookups will be set for a particular request/event.)

Use correlationid to map request ↔ event.

Flow details and responsibilities
When user adds/updates Contract address from Opportunity form

Option A (recommended):

Client JS on Opportunity form (or Contract quick-create) detects address field change and:

Calls Dynamics Web API to create an addressreview_request record with requestpayload containing address and contractid referencing the contract. Set status = Pending.

Inform the user via form notification: "Address queued for review."

External worker picks it up and publishes to Kafka.

Option B (server-side):

Register a plugin on Contract Create / Update (post-operation asynchronous step):

Plugin creates addressreview_request record (better than plugin contacting external systems).

Return quickly (async plugin prevents blocking user).

Why create request record instead of calling Kafka from plugin?

Avoid blocking CRM requests on external comms.

Maintain retry and auditability.

Safer for on-prem & cloud.

When user adds/updates Account address

Same flow: create addressreview_request with accountid set.

External worker (Azure Function / Node microservice)

Polls Dataverse for Pending requests (or subscribe using Dataverse change tracking / webhooks).

For each request:

Build message body with correlationId, address, metadata.

Produce to Kafka topic (address-review-requests).

Update request.status = Sent and set sent_on.

Implement retry/backoff and mark Failed after max retries.

Kafka Consumer (external)

Listens to address-review-responses topic.

On message:

Parse message; extract correlationId.

Create addressreview_event record in Dataverse containing the payload, score, verdict, correlationId, and related contract/account lookup (if included).

The addressreview_event Create will fire a Dataverse plugin.

Dataverse plugin on addressreview_event Create

Synchronous or asynchronous plugin? Prefer asynchronous (post-operation) to avoid blocking creation from external consumer.

Plugin logic:

Read addressreview_event record (payload, correlationId).

Map correlationId back to addressreview_request or directly to Account/Contract lookup.

Update the Account or Contract fields using IOrganizationService.Update:

e.g., set addressreview_status, addressreview_score, update address fields if auto-applied, set last_review_date.

Mark addressreview_event.processed = true and set appliedon.

Optionally create an audit/activity for business users.

Important: If the update requires business logic (e.g., update of related opportunity), consider an asynchronous plugin step or queue the update. Use optimistic locking / concurrency checks if necessary.

Security & Auth

External workers & Kafka consumers write to Dataverse via the Dataverse Web API using an application user (Azure AD app registration + client credentials) or service principal with least privilege.

Use TLS for all network traffic.

Correlation id must be unique (GUID). Store it both in request and message so tracing is simple.

Mask any PII in logs.

Operational notes

Implement retry/backoff for network and Kafka.

Implement idempotency in consumer: if a response with the same correlationId is received again, update existing event rather than create duplicates.

Keep retention policy for review events (e.g., purge older than X months).

Monitor queue depth and failures (Application Insights, Prometheus, etc.)

Logging and tracing across system using correlationId.

Plugin & JavaScript skeletons

Below are concise, ready-to-adapt code skeletons.

1) Client-side JavaScript (Dynamics form) — create AddressReviewRequest via Web API

Use this as a form onChange or ribbon button.

// createAddressReviewRequest.js
// Usage: call this from form OnSave or on address field OnChange
async function createAddressReviewRequest(entityLogicalName, entityId, addressPayload) {
  const record = {
    "name": "AddressReview:" + new Date().toISOString(),
    "correlationid": generateGuid(),
    "requestpayload": JSON.stringify(addressPayload),
    "requestdate": new Date().toISOString()
  };

  if (entityLogicalName === "account") {
    record["accountid@odata.bind"] = `/accounts(${entityId})`;
    record["originentity"] = "Account";
  } else if (entityLogicalName === "contract") {
    record["contractid@odata.bind"] = `/contracts(${entityId})`;
    record["originentity"] = "Contract";
  }

  try {
    const res = await Xrm.WebApi.createRecord("addressreview_requests", record);
    Xrm.Utility.showProgressIndicator("Address review queued");
    // Optionally refresh the form or set a notification
    Xrm.Utility.closeProgressIndicator();
    Xrm.Navigation.openAlertDialog({ text: "Address sent for review." });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    Xrm.Navigation.openAlertDialog({ text: "Failed to queue address review: " + err.message });
  }
}

function generateGuid() {
  // simple GUID for correlation id
  return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {
    var r = Math.random()*16|0, v = c=='x' ? r : (r&0x3|0x8);
    return v.toString(16);
  });
}


Hook this to the Opportunity/Contract/Account form: on address change, prepare addressPayload with line1, line2, city, pin, country, etc.

2) C# plugin skeleton to create AddressReviewRequest (registered asynchronous on Contract/Account Create/Update)

This creates the request record server-side (instead of client JS).

// AddressReviewRequestPlugin.cs
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
using System;

public class AddressReviewRequestPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        var context = (IPluginExecutionContext)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));
        var serviceFactory = (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
        var service = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);

        if (!context.InputParameters.Contains("Target")) return;
        var entity = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];

        // Only run for account or contract entities
        if (entity.LogicalName != "account" && entity.LogicalName != "contract") return;

        try
        {
            var addressPayload = new
            {
                line1 = entity.Contains("address1_line1") ? entity["address1_line1"] : null,
                city = entity.Contains("address1_city") ? entity["address1_city"] : null,
                postalCode = entity.Contains("address1_postalcode") ? entity["address1_postalcode"] : null
            };

            var correlationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

            var request = new Entity("addressreview_requests");
            request["name"] = "Request " + correlationId;
            request["correlationid"] = correlationId;
            request["requestpayload"] = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(addressPayload);
            request["requestdate"] = DateTime.UtcNow;

            if (entity.LogicalName == "account")
            {
                request["accountid"] = new EntityReference("account", entity.Id);
                request["originentity"] = "Account";
            }
            else
            {
                request["contractid"] = new EntityReference("contract", entity.Id);
                request["originentity"] = "Contract";
            }

            service.Create(request);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // log (Trace service) and swallow if asynchronous. Optionally rethrow if you want transaction rollback.
            var tracing = (ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));
            tracing.Trace("AddressReviewRequestPlugin error: " + ex.ToString());
            throw;
        }
    }
}


Register: asynchronous/post-operation on Create or Update (address fields) of account & contract.

3) Node.js Azure Function — poll Dataverse and produce to Kafka (producer)

This is a minimal sketch. Use kafkajs or similar library.

// sendToKafkaFunction.js (Azure Function or Node service)
const { Client } = require("@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client"); // or use Dataverse Web API via axios + OAuth
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

// Init Kafka
const kafka = new Kafka({
  clientId: 'address-review-producer',
  brokers: ['kafka1:9092','kafka2:9092']
});
const producer = kafka.producer();

async function produceMessage(topic, key, value) {
  await producer.connect();
  await producer.send({
    topic,
    messages: [{ key, value: JSON.stringify(value) }]
  });
  await producer.disconnect();
}

// Poll Dataverse for Pending requests (use Dataverse API with Azure AD auth)
async function getPendingRequests() {
  // call Dataverse Web API to query addressreview_requests where statuscode eq Pending
  // return an array
}

async function run() {
  const requests = await getPendingRequests();
  for (const req of requests) {
    const correlationId = req.correlationid;
    const payload = {
      correlationId,
      address: JSON.parse(req.requestpayload),
      metadata: {
        requestId: req.addressreviewrequestid,
        originEntity: req.originentity
      }
    };
    try {
      await produceMessage('address-review-requests', correlationId, payload);
      // Update request.status to Sent via Dataverse Web API
    } catch (err) {
      // update request.last_error, increment retrycount
    }
  }
}

// schedule run periodically or use change tracking / webhook


(Implement OAuth client credentials to Dataverse.)

4) Kafka Consumer to create AddressReviewEvent in Dataverse
// consumer.js
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'address-review-consumer', brokers: ['kafka1:9092'] });
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'address-review-group' });

async function handleMessage(msg) {
  const value = JSON.parse(msg.value.toString());
  const correlationId = value.correlationId || value.correlationid;
  // Build addressreview_event record
  const eventRecord = {
    name: 'Event ' + correlationId,
    correlationid: correlationId,
    eventpayload: JSON.stringify(value),
    eventdate: new Date().toISOString(),
    score: value.score || null,
    verdict: value.verdict || null
  };

  // optionally include accountid/contractid if present
  if (value.metadata && value.metadata.requestId) {
    // fetch original request to get account/contract refs and attach lookups
  }

  // create event using Dataverse Web API
  // Upsert idempotently: check existing event by correlationid
}

async function runConsumer() {
  await consumer.connect();
  await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'address-review-responses', fromBeginning: false });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
      try {
        await handleMessage(message);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error processing message: ', err);
      }
    }
  });
}

5) C# plugin on AddressReviewEvent.Create to apply the response
public class AddressReviewEventApplyPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        var context = (IPluginExecutionContext)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));
        var serviceFactory = (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
        var service = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);

        if (!context.InputParameters.Contains("Target")) return;
        var evt = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];
        if (evt.LogicalName != "addressreview_events") return;

        var correlationId = evt.GetAttributeValue<string>("correlationid");
        var payload = evt.GetAttributeValue<string>("eventpayload");

        // Query addressreview_request by correlationid to find related contract or account
        var requestQuery = new QueryExpression("addressreview_requests");
        requestQuery.Criteria.AddCondition("correlationid", ConditionOperator.Equal, correlationId);
        requestQuery.ColumnSet = new ColumnSet("accountid", "contractid");
        var result = service.RetrieveMultiple(requestQuery);
        if (result.Entities.Count == 0) return;
        var request = result.Entities[0];

        // Example: update account if present
        if (request.Contains("accountid"))
        {
            var acctRef = (EntityReference)request["accountid"];
            var acc = new Entity("account", acctRef.Id);
            acc["addressreview_status"] = "Reviewed"; // or set optionset
            acc["addressreview_lastpayload"] = payload;
            service.Update(acc);
        }
        else if (request.Contains("contractid"))
        {
            var conRef = (EntityReference)request["contractid"];
            var contract = new Entity("contract", conRef.Id);
            contract["addressreview_status"] = "Reviewed";
            contract["addressreview_lastpayload"] = payload;
            service.Update(contract);
        }

        // mark event processed
        var updateEvt = new Entity("addressreview_events", evt.Id);
        updateEvt["processed"] = true;
        updateEvt["appliedon"] = DateTime.UtcNow;
        service.Update(updateEvt);
    }
}


Register plugin step: asynchronous/post-operation on create of addressreview_events. If you want the update to be immediate for users, use synchronous postOperation plugin — but be careful about blocking the Kafka consumer’s write operation (it may be okay if the consumer runs in separate process).

Design tradeoffs

Storing within same Contract/Account entity

Pros:

Simpler queries and forms: you can show review score directly.

Fewer joins, less code for updates.

Cons:

No history of multiple reviews (unless you keep a history field).

Schema pollution: many fields for service metadata.

Harder to retry/reprocess.

Storing in separate entity (recommended)

Pros:

Full history, traceability, reprocessing, audit.

Easier to extend (multiple services, multiple events per request).

Cleaner separation of concerns.

Cons:

Slightly more complex UI: need subgrid or related view to show latest review on Account/Contract.

More integration code (but cleaner and scalable).

UX/UI suggestions

Show a subgrid on Contract / Account form: “Address Reviews” (addressreview_requests) sorted by requestdate.

Add a “Latest Review” read-only section with the most recent score & verdict (pull by fetchXml or rollup).

Add a ribbon command “Request Address Review” for manual triggering.

Registration steps checklist

Create new entities in solution: addressreview_request, addressreview_event.

Add lookup fields contractid, accountid and required fields shown above.

Create views and subgrids to show requests & events.

Deploy and register AddressReviewRequestPlugin async on Contract/Account Create/Update (address fields).

Deploy client JS for Opportunity/Contract/Account forms (optional).

Deploy Azure Function / Node producer to poll pending requests and send to Kafka.

Deploy Kafka consumer to create addressreview_event records.

Register plugin AddressReviewEventApplyPlugin on addressreview_event Create (async).

Test full flow with correlation id logs.

Non-functional & reliability considerations

Idempotency: ensure consumer checks for existing events with same correlationId.

Retries & DLQ: if Kafka consumer fails, use Dead Letter Topic and monitor.

Throughput: use batching for producing messages to Kafka if many requests.

Latency: If reviews are quick, consider push model; for slow reviews, inform users as “queued”.

Monitoring: implement metrics for pending requests, failed requests, consumer lag.

RBAC & least privilege: service principal should only have create/update on the custom entities and update on account/contract fields necessary.

Next steps I can do now

I can:

generate a full solution project skeleton (solution.xml + model xml) with entity definitions for import into Dataverse, and code files (C# plugin project and Node producer/consumer) ready to drop into your build pipeline; or

scaffold the exact form scripts, ribbon XML, and plugin registration steps (including exact message names / stage / filtering attributes) if you want to register the plugin step details and sample registration XML.

Which of the two would you like me to produce right now? (I can immediately output the project skeleton and code files in this chat.)

You said:
need to add opportunity id in the address review request and we need to consider when there is a address change in contract and account it will call address review , in this case how we tract last update address review response and show in the account or contract
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — thanks for clarifying.
We now need to (1) include Opportunity in the AddressReviewRequest, and (2) make sure that when Account or Contract address changes, the latest review response is clearly tracked and surfaced on the Account/Contract form.

Let me walk you through the updated design.

1. Schema updates
Entities

addressreview_request

addressreviewrequestid (GUID, PK)

name

correlationid

opportunityid (lookup to opportunity) ✅ new

contractid (lookup to contract, optional)

accountid (lookup to account, optional)

originentity (option set: Account / Contract)

requestpayload

requestdate

statuscode (Pending / Sent / Processed)

last_error, retrycount, etc.

addressreview_event

addressrevieweventid (GUID)

correlationid

opportunityid (lookup to opportunity) ✅ new

contractid (lookup to contract, optional)

accountid (lookup to account, optional)

eventpayload

score, verdict

eventdate

processed, appliedon

2. Tracking latest response

Two things:

History
Every review response is stored in addressreview_event. This keeps full history for audits and debugging.

Latest review pointer
On account and contract entities, add lookup fields:

latest_addressreview_eventid (lookup to addressreview_event)

latest_addressreview_score (decimal / text)

latest_addressreview_date (datetime)

This way, you can always query the event history but also show the latest score/status directly on the form without extra queries.

3. Business flow with Opportunity context
Scenario A: Address change on Opportunity’s Contract

User edits Contract address while working from Opportunity form.

Plugin or JS creates addressreview_request with:

contractid set

opportunityid set (from context)

Kafka request flows as before.

Response comes back → addressreview_event created with contractid + opportunityid.

Plugin on AddressReviewEvent.Create updates:

Contract → sets latest_addressreview_eventid, latest_score, latest_date.

Marks event as applied.

Scenario B: Address change on Opportunity’s Account

Same as above, but with accountid populated instead of contractid.

Scenario C: Direct Account/Contract address change (not via Opportunity)

Plugin on Account/Contract Update fires:

Creates addressreview_request with accountid or contractid.

opportunityid is null in this case.

Response flow same, plugin updates latest review pointers.

4. Plugin adjustments
AddressReviewEventApplyPlugin (updated)
public class AddressReviewEventApplyPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        var context = (IPluginExecutionContext)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));
        var serviceFactory = (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
        var service = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);

        if (!context.InputParameters.Contains("Target")) return;
        var evt = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];
        if (evt.LogicalName != "addressreview_event") return;

        var correlationId = evt.GetAttributeValue<string>("correlationid");
        var payload = evt.GetAttributeValue<string>("eventpayload");
        var score = evt.Contains("score") ? evt["score"] : null;
        var eventDate = evt.GetAttributeValue<DateTime?>("eventdate");

        // Update Account or Contract
        if (evt.Contains("accountid"))
        {
            var acctRef = evt.GetAttributeValue<EntityReference>("accountid");
            var acc = new Entity("account", acctRef.Id);
            acc["latest_addressreview_eventid"] = new EntityReference("addressreview_event", evt.Id);
            acc["latest_addressreview_score"] = score;
            acc["latest_addressreview_date"] = eventDate ?? DateTime.UtcNow;
            service.Update(acc);
        }
        else if (evt.Contains("contractid"))
        {
            var conRef = evt.GetAttributeValue<EntityReference>("contractid");
            var contract = new Entity("contract", conRef.Id);
            contract["latest_addressreview_eventid"] = new EntityReference("addressreview_event", evt.Id);
            contract["latest_addressreview_score"] = score;
            contract["latest_addressreview_date"] = eventDate ?? DateTime.UtcNow;
            service.Update(contract);
        }

        // mark event processed
        var updateEvt = new Entity("addressreview_event", evt.Id);
        updateEvt["processed"] = true;
        updateEvt["appliedon"] = DateTime.UtcNow;
        service.Update(updateEvt);
    }
}

5. UI / Form design

On Account form and Contract form:

Show read-only fields:

Latest Address Review Score

Latest Review Date

Subgrid: Address Review Events (history)

On Opportunity form:

Subgrid: Address Review Requests (linked by Opportunity ID).

6. Why this works well

You have full history of all review requests/responses.

Always a single pointer to the latest result, displayed directly on Account/Contract.

Opportunity link allows you to trace which Opportunity triggered the review.

Works whether triggered via Opportunity form or direct edits.

👉 Do you want me to draft the solution schema (entities, fields, relationships) as a ready-to-import XML/JSON (Dataverse solution export style), or should I expand the plugin registration details (steps, filtering attributes, message & stage setup) next?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s draft the Dataverse / Dynamics 365 solution schema for your scenario.
I’ll give you a structured definition of entities, fields, and relationships so you can either:

Build them manually in Solution Designer, or

Convert to solution XML / JSON if you prefer automation.

Address Review - Design & Implementation
Address Review Management — Design & Implementation

Version: 1.0

Date: 2025-09-13

Audience: Dynamics 365 / Dataverse developers, integration engineers, DevOps

1. Executive summary

This document describes a robust design and implementation plan for integrating a Kafka-based Address Review service with Dynamics 365 (Dataverse) where:

Opportunity has M:1 relationship with Contract and Account.

Address changes on Account or Contract (including when edited via an Opportunity form) trigger an Address Review request.

Requests are persisted in Dataverse (AddressReviewRequest) and sent to the external Address Review service via Kafka.

Responses are ingested by a Kafka consumer which creates AddressReviewEvent records in Dataverse.

A Dataverse plugin applies the latest response to the related Account or Contract and sets a pointer to the latest event.

The design emphasizes auditability, idempotency, non-blocking CRM operations, and traceability back to Opportunity.

2. Goals and non-goals

Goals

Maintain full history of requests and responses.

Surface the latest review result directly on Account and Contract forms.

Support requests originating from Opportunity context (store Opportunity lookup).

Keep CRM responsive (no direct blocking calls to external services from sync plugin).

Provide reliable handoff to Kafka and idempotent consumer processing.

Non-goals

Implementing the external Address Review service itself (assumed third-party).

Fine-grained UI polishing beyond subgrids and read-only fields.

3. High-level architecture
[User in CRM]
    └─(edits address on Account/Contract or from Opportunity)→ Client JS / Async Plugin creates AddressReviewRequest
        └─(persisted in Dataverse)
        └─External Worker (Azure Function / Node) polls/receives new Pending requests → produces Kafka messages
            └─Address Review Service (3rd party) processes requests and publishes responses to Kafka
                └─Kafka Consumer (Node/Java) picks response → creates AddressReviewEvent in Dataverse
                    └─Dataverse Plugin on AddressReviewEvent.Create updates Account/Contract latest pointers and fields

Key components

Dataverse entities: addressreview_request, addressreview_event + enhancements to account, contract.

Client-side scripts for optional immediate UX (button / onChange triggers).

Async server plugins to create requests when address fields change.

External producer (poller or webhook forwarder) that sends to Kafka.

Kafka consumer which writes responses into Dataverse.

Plugin that applies the latest event to Account/Contract.

4. Entities, fields, relationships (concise)
4.1 addressreview_request (logical: new_addressreview_request)

PrimaryId: new_addressreviewrequestid (Guid)

PrimaryName: new_name (string)

Fields: new_correlationid (string), new_requestpayload (multiline text), new_requestdate (datetime), statuscode (optionset: Pending/Sent/Failed/Processed), new_retrycount (int), new_lasterror (multiline), new_originentity (optionset: Account/Contract), new_senton (datetime)

Lookups: new_accountid (account), new_contractid (contract), new_opportunityid (opportunity)

4.2 addressreview_event (logical: new_addressreview_event)

PrimaryId: new_addressrevieweventid (Guid)

PrimaryName: new_name (string)

Fields: new_correlationid (string), new_eventpayload (multiline), new_eventdate (datetime), new_score (decimal), new_verdict (optionset: Pass/Fail/ReviewNeeded), new_processed (two-options), new_appliedon (datetime)

Lookups: new_accountid, new_contractid, new_opportunityid

4.3 Account and Contract enhancements

new_latestreviewscore (decimal 18,2)

new_latestreviewdate (datetime)

new_latestrevieweventid (lookup to new_addressreview_event)

5. Data flow & lifecycle

Trigger: User updates address on Account or Contract (or via Opportunity form). This can be detected in two ways:

Client-side: JS on form OnChange of address fields or a ribbon button — calls Web API to create a addressreview_request record with correlationId (GUID), requestpayload, and lookups (account, contract, opportunity if available).

Server-side: Asynchronous plugin (recommended) registered on Account/Contract Post-Operation Update for filtered address attributes — plugin creates the addressreview_request record.

Producer: An external worker (Azure Function / Node) queries Dataverse for addressreview_request with statuscode = Pending. For each record:

Build Kafka message with correlationId, requestpayload, metadata (request id, lookups).

Produce to Kafka topic address-review-requests.

Update request statuscode = Sent and new_senton timestamp.

Service / Response: External Address Review service processes and publishes response to Kafka topic address-review-responses with the same correlationId.

Consumer: Kafka consumer receives the response, performs idempotency check (exists event with same correlationId?). If not exists, it:

Creates addressreview_event record in Dataverse with payload, score, verdict, lookups if included.

Apply plugin: Plugin on addressreview_event Create applies necessary updates to Account or Contract:

Update new_latestrevieweventid to this event, new_latestreviewscore, new_latestreviewdate.

Optionally update address fields if auto-apply is required (policy decision).

Mark new_processed = true on the event and set new_appliedon.

UI: Account and Contract forms show latest score + subgrid of events for history.

6. Idempotency, retries and error handling

Producer retries: If Kafka produce fails, increment new_retrycount and store new_lasterror. After N retries, mark statuscode = Failed.

Consumer idempotency: Use new_correlationid as unique key. Consumer should attempt to upsert the event by searching existing events by new_correlationid. If exists, skip or update.

Plugin robustness: Plugin should use ITracingService and catch exceptions to avoid toxic failures. Register apply plugin as asynchronous post-operation to avoid blocking consumer writes.

DLQ: For unprocessable responses, consumer should move messages to a dead-letter topic and log details.

7. Security & Auth

Use Azure AD App Registration + Client Credentials (application user) for services writing to Dataverse via Web API.

Grant minimal scopes (Application permissions) only to necessary entities and CRUD operations.

Secure Kafka with TLS and SASL (or Azure Event Hubs Kafka interface) and use network-level restrictions.

Mask PII in logs and follow retention/privacy rules.

8. Implementation artifacts

Below are code snippets and instructions you can use as a starting implementation.

NOTE: the code below is skeleton/demo code that requires adaptation (error handling, authentication, configuration) before production use.

8.1 Client-side JavaScript: Create AddressReviewRequest
// file: createAddressReviewRequest.js
async function createAddressReviewRequest(entityLogicalName, entityId, opportunityId, addressPayload) {
  const correlationId = generateGuid();
  const record = {
    new_name: "ARR-" + new Date().toISOString(),
    new_correlationid: correlationId,
    new_requestpayload: JSON.stringify(addressPayload),
    new_requestdate: new Date().toISOString()
  };


  if (opportunityId) record["new_opportunityid@odata.bind"] = `/opportunities(${opportunityId})`;
  if (entityLogicalName === "account") record["new_accountid@odata.bind"] = `/accounts(${entityId})`;
  if (entityLogicalName === "contract") record["new_contractid@odata.bind"] = `/contracts(${entityId})`;


  const res = await Xrm.WebApi.createRecord("new_addressreview_request", record);
  return { id: res.id, correlationId };
}


function generateGuid() {
  return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {
    var r = Math.random()*16|0, v = c=='x' ? r : (r&0x3|0x8);
    return v.toString(16);
  });
}

Hook: address fields OnChange or save event; or a ribbon button.

8.2 C# plugin — Create AddressReviewRequest (Async plugin on Account/Contract Update)
// AddressReviewRequestPlugin.cs
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Query;
using System;


public class AddressReviewRequestPlugin : IPlugin {
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) {
        var context = (IPluginExecutionContext)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));
        var serviceFactory = (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
        var service = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);
        var tracing = (ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));


        if (!context.InputParameters.Contains("Target")) return;
        var entity = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];


        if (entity.LogicalName != "account" && entity.LogicalName != "contract") return;


        try {
            var payload = new {
                line1 = entity.Contains("address1_line1") ? entity["address1_line1"] : null,
                city = entity.Contains("address1_city") ? entity["address1_city"] : null,
                postalCode = entity.Contains("address1_postalcode") ? entity["address1_postalcode"] : null
            };


            var correlationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();


            var request = new Entity("new_addressreview_request");
            request["new_name"] = "ARR-" + DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ");
            request["new_correlationid"] = correlationId;
            request["new_requestpayload"] = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
            request["new_requestdate"] = DateTime.UtcNow;


            if (entity.LogicalName == "account") request["new_accountid"] = new EntityReference("account", entity.Id);
            else request["new_contractid"] = new EntityReference("contract", entity.Id);


            service.Create(request);


        } catch (Exception ex) {
            tracing.Trace("AddressReviewRequestPlugin error: " + ex.ToString());
            throw;
        }
    }
}

Register: asynchronous/postOperation on Update for the address fields (filter attributes: address1_line1, address1_city, address1_postalcode, etc.) for both account and contract.




I've created the design + implementation document for the Address Review solution in a workspace for you: "Address Review - Design & Implementation".
Open it in the canvas (it's ready and contains architecture, entity schemas, code skeletons, deployment notes, and an entity JSON template).

Would you like me to now:

export a Power Platform solution XML (customizations.xml) for direct import, or

scaffold a Git repo with plugin projects + Node producer/consumer + registration scripts?

Pick one and I’ll generate the requested artifacts next.
